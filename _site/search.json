The plot highlights notable disparities regarding punctuality on airline performance.\nThere are two outliers, American Airlines(AA) and American Eagle Airlines (MQ). AA exhibits the worst performance on late departures, with a maximum delay of 3890 minutes, and also shows the one of the highest early departures, reaching 60 minutes. MQ ranks second on the chart with the maximum late departure of 2248 minutes. For the remaining of the 15 airlines, they are well within the 500 to 1500 minute range for late departures and have negligible early departures. Hawaii Airlines (HA) is the best airline in terms of punctuality. \nAirlines with extreme delay instances should investigate the root causes. Addressing outliers can significantly improve the overall airline performance and customer satisfactions. While plot 1 yields actionable insights, the analysis could be largely complemented by examining average early and delayed departures by minutes for each airline, which may offer a more comprehensive picture of the on-time performance.",

The analysis aggregates the top cancellation reasons per airport and examines their regional distribution.\nPlot 2 visualizes the most frequent reasons for flight cancellations at airports across the United States, grouped into four reasons: Carrier-related, Weather-related, National Air System, and Security. Carrier-related reasons spread across the country, and Security-related cancellations are centered on the South and East. Counterintuitively, weather doesn’t appear as a big issue in the plot, likely due to the dataset’s focus on the summer month, a period with fewer weather disruptions compared to winter.\nPlot 3 illustrates the total counts of each cancellation, colored by region. Carrier-related issues account for the majority of cancellations, totaling 972 incidents across all regions. These issues are most pronounced in the South and Midwest, which could possibly imply operational inefficiencies or staffing shortage. Security, ranked second with 757 incidents, highlights the need to continuously strengthen security protections at key airports. The National Air System reason is negligible. Weather disproportionately affects west and south, indicating regional vulnerability to geographic and seasonal factors.\nAirlines should prioritize improving resource allocation, staffing, and scheduling to reduce cancellations caused by carrier inefficiencies. And airlines should work together with airports in the West and South to prepare various weather situations and contingency plans.",

Plot 4 highlights changes in flight traffic on different days, revealing the busiest and least busy days for air travel. Friday presents to be the busiest day in July 2020, with 59737 number of flights in total, closely followed by Thursday with 59555 number of flights. The busy traffic on Thursdays and Fridays indicate that passengers travel a lot to prepare themselves for the weekend. Tuesday and Saturday are the least busiest days of the week, with volumes of 42552 and 43322 respectively. Flight numbers grow sharply from Tuesday to Wednesday to Thursday, suggesting a high demand on air travel in the mid-week.\nIn order to coordinate busy midweek traffic, airlines should increase staffing and resources on those days to ensure smooth operation of high demand. Airlines could also offer discounted tickets on less busy days to counterbalance the difference in demand during the week.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary:\nThis data science project uses Reddit discussion data to analyze users’ attitudes and perceptions toward anti-obesity medications for weight management. A range of data techniques is applied, and policy implications are explored to identify gaps between users’ needs and current healthcare offerings.\n\n\nData Source:\nThis study uses Reddit data to assess users’ attitudes toward anti-obesity drugs and the challenges they encounter, such as high costs, limited access, and insurance issues. Data is collected via the Reddit API from 21 popular subreddits related to health and weight management, including loseit, obesity, AskDocs, nutrition, PCOS, diabetes, and fitness, among others. Queries include keywords such as “weight loss,” “health,” “Medicare,” and specific anti-obesity drugs, like Semaglutide.\nFor each subreddit, I query these keywords to extract relevant discussions. The results are stored in a data frame containing post titles, main text, comment counts, upvote/downvote scores, URL links, all comments, and subreddit names. To ensure diversity, I set a limit of 200 posts per query, although some subreddits do not reach this cap. In total, 3,800 posts and their associated comments are collected.\nAfter removing duplicates and null values, the dataset contains 1,543 entries. On average, each post has 184 comments (standard deviation: 242) and a score of 788 (standard deviation: 1,753), indicating significant variance in engagement levels. Outliers, calculated based on the Interquartile Range (IQR), are removed for better consistency.\nSince my research focuses on individual perspectives, I apply the expand function to the comment column, allowing each comment to form its own row. After this transformation, the dataset contains 26,014 rows.\n\n\nVideo:\n\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag. You can download the video instead. \n\n\nFindings and Limitations:\nIn summary, users exhibit a generally positive attitude across the dataset, but sentiments vary significantly across topic clusters and entities. Government healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid are viewed favorably, which suggests an opportunity for policymakers to expand coverage to include weight-loss drugs, a measure already proposed by the Biden administration. Under current Medicare Part D regulations, individuals with pre-existing conditions like diabetes can access these medications, but obese individuals must often wait until a serious health condition develops to qualify for coverage. This delay not only harms patients but also increases long-term costs for insurance companies, as treating more severe health conditions, often exacerbated by obesity, becomes significantly more expensive. Moreover, some studies suggest that pressure on Medicare and Medicaid to cover anti-obesity drugs could encourage private insurance companies to assume greater responsibility for similar coverage.\nOne limitation is that TF-IDF prioritizes term importance based on frequency and uniqueness but does not capture relationships between terms. In contrast, association rule mining focuses on co-occurrences, which may underrepresent standalone frequent terms like “insurance”. This gap limits a comprehensive understanding of term significance. As a next step, introducing bigrams and trigrams could help uncover more meaningful patterns and relationships between terms.\nReddit discussions may not fully represent broader populations due to self-selection bias and the platform’s demographics. Additionally, discussions about insurance and healthcare costs might be underreported due to their sensitivity. To address this issue, scraping data from other parts of the Internet and incorporating multiple social platforms for data collection could provide a broader and more balanced dataset.",
