Hi, welcome to Vika's personal page! I'm currently pursuing a Master’s degree in **Data Science for Public Policy** at Georgetown University and actively seeking a full-time position in the United States starting June 2025.

Before graduate school, I earned my bachelor's degree in **Psychology and Education** from New York University and gained 1.5 years of experience as a research assistant in a developmental psychology program. My passion for **life sciences** and the **healthcare industry** has shaped my academic and professional journey.

Throughout my graduate studies, I’ve focused on **health policy** and the application of **machine learning techniques** in disease diagnosis. Currently, I serve as a Policy Analyst, Data Analyst, and Website Manager at the Healthcare Financing Initiative at Georgetown University. Additionally, I’ve gained industry experience through internships at Siemens Healthineers, various startups as a Marketing and Product Intern, and soon, I’ll be joining the Government Affairs Team at Elanco’s DC office.

Please explore the different sections of my website to learn more about my work. In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking, and video editing.
